# Binary Search Optimization
### Project Purpose:
This project explores optimizing binary search for large datasets that are unbalanced or non-uniformly distributed.
### Objective:
To enhance the efficiency of search operations in large datasets by exploring alternative search techniques, specifically exponential search and interpolation search.
### Challenge:
Traditional binary search has limitations on unbalanced or non-uniform datasets; advanced algorithms can improve search times in these cases.
