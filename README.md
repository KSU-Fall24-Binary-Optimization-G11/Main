# Binary Search Optimization: Enhancing Efficiency for Scalable Data Systems

## Project Overview

This project investigates the optimization of search algorithms in instances where the datasets are **skewed or distributed non-uniformly**. The motivation is to incorporate advanced searching techniques and introduce a user friendly interface to solve the problems of search in large data bases.

### Project Purpose

To optimize binary search for large, unbalanced datasets.

### Objective

To achieve the increased efficiency of searching operations through the study of other search methods, specifically exponential and interpolation search techniques.

### Challenge

Conventional methods of binary search do not work on skewed or non-uniform datasets; rather, improved algorithms can use such time efficiency for the search.
